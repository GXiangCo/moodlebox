# MoodleBox

A project to build a Moodle server and Wi-Fi router on a Raspberry Pi 3.

## How to use a MoodleBox

Visit the [MoodleBox web site](https://moodlebox.net) for more information about the MoodleBox features or any question about the usage of a MoodleBox.

## Building the MoodleBox

To build a MoodleBox from scratch with this script, you need a Raspberri Pi 3 (Wi-Fi!) and follow these instructions.

1. Clone Rasbpian Stretch Lite on your microSD card
1. Create a `ssh` file on the `boot` partition, e.g. `touch ssh`
1. Start your RPi and log into it with the default user pi: `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local` (password: `raspberry`)
1. Upgrade your Raspbian installation: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y` and exit: `exit`
1. Prepare a file `authorized_keys` on your computer, containing your public keys
1. Download [script `copy-sshkeys-to-rpi.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martignoni/make-moodlebox/master/copy-sshkeys-to-rpi.sh), launch `bash copy-sshkeys-to-rpi.sh` and enter the pi user default password (`raspberry`)
1. Login to your RPi with the user root (no password required): `ssh root@raspberrypi.local`
1. Launch `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martignoni/make-moodlebox/master/make_moodlebox.sh | bash`

## Availability

The code is available at [https://github.com/martignoni/make-moodlebox](https://github.com/martignoni/make-moodlebox).

A [prepared disk image](https://moodlebox.net/en/dl) of the latest released version is [available for downloading](https://moodlebox.net/en/dl), cloning on your microSD card and using out of the box on your Raspberry Pi 3.
